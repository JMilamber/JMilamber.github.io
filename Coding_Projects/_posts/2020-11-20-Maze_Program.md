mediumDescription: Started after my first final project in my first coding class, this program contains two working wall-adder algorithms that produce Perfect-2D-Orthogonal Mazes (perfect here means only one solution). It is run by a main program from which you can run both mazes. It has a handcrafted UI made with TKinter and has the option to save its mazes as images.  # longer paragraph description.

### *Github: [(link)](https://github.com/JMilamber/Maze-Programs)*

I wrote my first maze algorithm in fall of 2018, for a java class. It was
exceedingly long and cumbersome, but very fun to use. When I started learning
Python in the spring of 2019, I challenged myself to re-write my maze-program
in Python. Once this was done, I decided to create a Github repo to help keep
track of what I was working on. Continuing to work on the project I decided
to write a second algorithm for the program and a UI as my final project
for my python class in spring of 2019.

Since then I have worked on the repo off and on for the past year/two years.
I have plans for a test Suite, another algorithm, and an eventual complete
restructuring of the program for better re-usability.
