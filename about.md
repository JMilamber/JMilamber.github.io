## Bio
Hi my name is Jacob and I am currently Senior at Allegheny college with a Major in Theatre and a Minor in Computer Science. I love pretty much anything to do with games: both playing them and watching them, and it is my goal to one day be a part of building them as well. I am currently learning Unity and video-editing, and hope to find an Internship/Job in game development in the next 1-2 years.
