## Short Bio

  <ul>Hi, my name is Jacob and I am currently a senior at Allegheny College with a major in Theatre and a minor in Computer Science. I love pretty much anything to do with games: playing them, watching them, and it is my goal to one day be a part of building them as well. I am currently learning Unity and video-editing, and hope to find an Internship/Job in game development in the next 1-2 years.</ul>
