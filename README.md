## Short Bio

  <ul>Hi, my name is Jacob and I am a Graduate of Allegheny College with a Bachelors Degree in Theatre and a minor in Computer Science. I love pretty much anything to do with games from playing them, to watching them, to modding them, and it is my goal to one day be a part of developing them as well. I have 5 years of experience writing code in both Python and Java. Recently I have also learned a great deal of embedded C code.</ul>
